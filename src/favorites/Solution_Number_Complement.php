 *
 * Given a positive integer num, output its complement number.
 * The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
 *
 *
    Example 1:
    Input: num = 5
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010.
    So you need to output 2.
 *
    Example 2:
    Input: num = 1
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0.
    So you need to output 0.
 * Constraints:
 * The given integer num is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 * num >= 1
 * You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
